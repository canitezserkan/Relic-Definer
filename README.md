# Relic-Definer
This program was developed for a third-person shooter game called Warframe as an useful tool in terms of showing to player which in-game item is more valuable among the others. Values of these items are changing constantly and the program is able to search the values for chosen items if theseitems haven't been evaluated within the last 24-hours. It was written with C# and combined with MS SQL using Entity Framework. It's the finest work I have ever done so far. More coming.

Here is a youtube video link for demonstration about how the program works. www.youtube.com/
